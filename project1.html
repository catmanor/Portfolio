                        The name of the project is Aliens. The goal of the project is to practice the click 
                        event and to train the ability about variable calculating in processing. I’m the 
                        graphic designer and application developer, and completed it by myself. 
                        The project was a three-week student project and also a freelance project for the 
                        client. The tool and techniques I used in the application is Processing and PVector.

                        Alien is a two-dimension game for users to use mouse as their weapon to kill the aliens. The goal of the game is to make the content and drawing can be associated tightly. 

Outline for solving the problem: Hard to calculate objects collision accurately </p>
<ul>
    <li>Did the research online </li>
    <li>Add visible bound to objects and test</li>
    <li>Debug</li>
    <li>Checked any problems may happen</li>
    <li>Make the visible bound line invisible</li>
</ul>
<p>
The research online was the first thing. And then, I added bound line to the target object. It’s easy for me to check whether the new method work or not. Next, tested and debugged again and again. After that, I checked the possible cases that might make errors. Finally, I cancel the bound lines, which is not needed in the final project.

The result is that object collision can be checked accurately. I solved the problem through the outline above. In this program, I think some auxiliary items are helpful for us to find and solve the problems.
