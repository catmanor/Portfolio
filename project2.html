                        The name of the project is Manager. I’m the software designer and developer of the application, and completed it by myself. The project was a term ending project and also a freelance project for the client. The tool and techniques I used in the application is Android Studios, camera sensor and SQL database.                    </p>

                        Focus is an application for users to avoid spending too much time on smart phone but focus on their study and work. In the application, users can set a time to countdown, and then they cannot use their smart phone during the setting time. 

Outline for solving the problem: When the sensor was called frequently, application would crash.
 </p>
<ul>
    <li>Did the research online </li>
    <li>Took a note to record the research</li>
    <li>Changed the code correspond to the related note</li>
    <li>Test</li>
    <li>Checked any problems may happen</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The research online was the first thing. And then, I recorded different methods to solve the problems because every case was different. According to the related notes, I tried them in my coding. Tested and debugged. Finally, I checked the possible cases that might make error.

    The result of the application will not crash whatever situation it was. I solved the problem through the outline above. I think it’s important to understand the solving method learned from online research before use it into own application.
